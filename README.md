# bash_examples
Learn bash by examples.

This project is a tutorial with lots of code examples in bash. 
The aim of this project is to learn bash scripting through a minum set of theory and explanations on each lesson
and multiple examples. 

The project is not meant to be a programming course for beginners, it is a self-learning tutorial or a go-to place
to easily check the bash syntax. The project is aimed to experienced programmers on other languages that want to
learn bash quickly or just want to do a fast check on the syntax.

The code tries to be as intuitive and illustrative as possible. The lessons are are numbered in order of difficulty,
like a tutorial/course would do. The project is organized in the following directories:

 - __basic__ : The basics of the bash language programming. In this category each lesson will be contained on its own
           directory and directory's lessons will be numbered from 000 to 999. Each lesson contains its own *.md file
           with the explanations and one or multiple bash scripts as code examples.
           Each bash script will have at the beginning its own header to explain the purpose of the script.
 - __intermediate__ : In this category the examples will be divided by topics. In order to ease the search for topics please 
                      try to avoid having sub-topics (sub-directories) inside each topic. Inside each topic order the files
                      with the same criteria as the basic category. Sort each topic (directory) of the intermediate category 
                      by using a number from 00 to 99.
 - __advanced__  : The advance topics can combine one or multiple of basic and intermediate topics. The advance topics will be
                    classified into different directories and inside each topic can be one or multiple sub-topics, but please 
                    try to avoid nesting as much as possible. Use the same criteria for the directories as in the intermediate
                   topics.
 - __projects__ : Small projects that illustrate the concepts learned in the different categories. These projects are contained 
                  in its own subdirectory since they are small apps that are composed of multiple *.py files and additional 
                  external resources (images, text files, etc...). These mini-project examples might contain its own Readme.md 
                  file.
